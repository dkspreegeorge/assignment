# JSON/HTTP Timestamp Service

This is an implementation of a JSON/HTTP service in Golang that returns the matching timestamps of a periodic task. The goal of this assignment is to create a simple and easy-to-use service for finding the matching timestamps of a periodic task.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
```

2. Change into the project directory.


```
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
```

3. Build and run the service.

```
go build
./YOUR_REPO_NAME -listen addr:port
```
