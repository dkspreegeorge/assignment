JSON/HTTP Timestamp Service

This is an implementation of a JSON/HTTP service in Golang that returns the matching timestamps of a periodic task. The goal of this assignment is to create a simple and easy-to-use service for finding the matching timestamps of a periodic task.

bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

    Change into the project directory.

bash

cd YOUR_REPO_NAME

    Build and run the service.

go

go build
